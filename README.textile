Project used to experiment with Thrift. Uses gradle to build.


h1. Before building / running

make sure thrift 0.3 is installed from http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/download/ 
make sure gradle (>= 0.9) is installed

h1. Layout

* actual code in src/main/java
* thrift file(s) in src/main/thrift/
* generated sources (by thrift) are in src/generated/java/gen-javabean/
* configuration and resources in src/main/resources

h1. Compiling

Generate and compile all source using:

<pre>gradle compileJava</pre>

h1. Running

Run the server (on port 1234) using:

<pre>gradle runServer</pre>

Run the client using:

<pre>gradle runClient</pre>

Both these tasks call the compile task before running.
